<h2>Lab Exercise 1</h2>
<h2>Create a HTML page with first para use external css, second para use internal css, third para use inline css</h2>

<p id='para1'>A HTML marquee is a scrolling piece of text displayed either horizontally across or vertically down your web site page depending on the settings.</p><hr>

<p id='para2'> HTML lets you specify metadata - information about a document rather than document content -in a variety of ways. The META element can be used to include name/value pairs describing properties of the HTML document, such as author, Expiry Date, a list of key words, author etc.</p><hr>

<p style="color:green;font-size:30px;font-family:'Lucida Console', Monaco, monospace;text-align:left;">Metadata provided by using meta tag is a very important part of the web. It can assist search engines in finding the best match when a user performs a search. Search engines will often look at any metadata attached to a page - especially keywords - and rank it higher than another page with less relevant metadata, or with no metadata at all.</p><hr>
